# HAck-Buddy_Hackdays-Sellular

Hi everyone & Sellular hackathon Judges 

We, The Team of HAck-Buddy : Hiresh Yadav and Anjali Hedaoo present you the frontend design of a Hackathon-Management-System.

The Backend part is made for future use, when we connect it with database it will work properly and easy to use for organiser of hackathon to give all the information using Hackathon-Management-System and also for the user or participants to easy login and apply for the hackathon.

After the successful submission there we also created page for judges. So that they can easily get all the information about every participants submission and for the selection of the winner.
